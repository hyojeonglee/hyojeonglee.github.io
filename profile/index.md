## Hyo-jeong Lee (Ellen). Seoul, Korea
I'm in my M.S degree at Seoul National University in Korea. Currently, I'm studying scalable techniques on system and interested in followings:
* Parallel Computing
* Linux/Unix environment
* System performance tuning
* Troubleshooting with multi-thread concurrency
* Automation in the development process
* Computer Science Education

In detail, 
* Parallel Garbage Collection policy of Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* Scalable logging technique on Database system.
* Memory management of Linux Kernel.
* Distributed File System (i.e. HDFS, Lustre) and data management middleware.
* GPU memory management on Docker container. (TODO)
