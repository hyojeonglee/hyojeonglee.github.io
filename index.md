## Hyo-jeong Lee. Seoul, Korea
I graduated from Seoul National University in Korea with a master’s degree in computer science and majored in scalable techniques on system. Currently, I am working for SK Telecom.

I am interested in followings:
* Parallel Computing
* Troubleshooting with multi-thread concurrency
* Linux/Unix environment
* System performance tuning
* Automation in the development process
* Computer Science Education

In detail, 
* Parallel Garbage Collection policy of Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
* Memory management of Operating System (e.g., Linux Kernel).
* GPU memory management on virtualized environment (e.g., Docker container).
* Scalable logging technique on Database system.
* Distributed File System (e.g., HDFS, Lustre) and data management middleware.
